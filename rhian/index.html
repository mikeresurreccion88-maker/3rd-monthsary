<!-- 1ST MONTH — PAST TENSE -->
<div id="month1" class="letter">
    <h1>1st Monthsary ❤️</h1>

    <p>That first month with you already felt meaningful in ways I didn’t expect. Looking back now, it was the month where everything quietly began—where two people started learning each other, understanding each other, and slowly choosing each other.</p>

    <p>During that time, we were still figuring things out. We were learning habits, moods, and the small ways we showed care. Yet even in that early stage, I already felt a connection that felt genuine and real. You became someone I looked forward to talking to every day without even realizing it.</p>

    <p>You made me feel seen and appreciated during that first month. The simple messages, the effort, the consistency—those things mattered more to me than you probably knew. It wasn’t about grand gestures; it was about how natural everything felt with you.</p>

    <p>That first month taught me that love doesn’t always arrive loudly. Sometimes it arrives quietly, gently, and unexpectedly—and before you know it, it’s already there, growing.</p>

    <p>Looking back now, I realize that first month was the foundation. It was where comfort started, where trust slowly formed, and where something real began.</p>

    <h1>2nd Monthsary 💗</h1>

    <p>By the second month, what we had already started to feel deeper and more meaningful. It wasn’t just excitement anymore—it became about understanding, patience, and choosing each other even when things weren’t easy.</p>

    <p>During that second month, we experienced moments that tested us in small ways. There were days when we were tired, moments when things felt heavy, and times when silence said more than words. Still, we stayed. We listened. We chose to understand.</p>

    <p>I appreciated how you were there for me during that time—especially on days when I wasn’t okay. You didn’t force anything; you simply stayed, and that alone meant more than any words could.</p>

    <p>That second month allowed me to know you beyond the surface. I saw your fears, your dreams, and your imperfections—and instead of loving you less, I found myself loving you more.</p>

    <p>Looking back now, the second month was when our connection started to feel safe. It felt steady. It felt real. It felt like something worth protecting.</p>

<!-- 3RD MONTH — PRESENT + LATE GIFT -->
<div id="month3" class="letter">
    <h1>3rd Monthsary 💖</h1>

    <p>Three months with you, and now I can honestly say that you have become an important part of my everyday life. You’re the person I think about when my day starts and the one I want to talk to when it ends.</p>

    <p>This month made me realize that what I feel for you is no longer just excitement—it’s comfort. You became my safe place, my calm, and my sense of peace in moments when everything feels overwhelming.</p>

    <p>Thank you for loving me in ways that feel genuine and unforced. Thank you for choosing me even on days when I’m not easy to love. Your consistency, patience, and effort mean more to me than you’ll ever know.</p>

    <p>I also want to be honest with you—my gift for you might be a little late. It may not be here exactly today, but I chose it with you in mind. I wanted it to be something meaningful, something that reflects how important you are to me. Please wait for it just a little longer.</p>

    <p>Right now, I don’t just love you. I choose you—every single day. Through good days, bad days, and everything in between.</p>

    <p>Happy 3rd monthsary, my love. I don’t know exactly what the future holds, but I know I want you in it. Always.</p>
